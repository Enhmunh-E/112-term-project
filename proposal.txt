# Project Name: Super Ultra Minelorant

Following project is a game that combines block like world from minecraft with an intricate gun play, inviting competitive gameplay from valorant.

## Competitive Analysis:

There is a mobile game called PixelGun where it combines guns with blocks, the same principle for my game. However, on PixelGun it does not allow users to modify the game world in game, not giving immersive experience. There are also valorant mods in Minecraft where Valorant is implemented in them as an addition.
Also, if it wasn't a block game, then it would be similar to Fortnite.

The main component that my game is different than the following games is that, it will have blocks in which are breakable also, you can't put any blokcs in game. By adding guns, it will provide more creative gameplay and thus be more favorable to the people.

## Structural Plan:
Project will be organized in a way that it is categorized depending on the usage.
For example:
I will have util functions on one file, classes on another and base cmu_graphics on the other so that all the files are sorted and easy to understand. I will also add assets folder in which I will add my objects and pictures.

## Algorithmic plan:
The trickiest part would be implementing camera orientation for selecting a block. I would approach this through geometric formula where it could find the intersection of a camera line to the plane.

## Timeline plan:
tp1: base graphics
tp2: block collision and deletion and creation
tp3: creative update

## Version Control Plan:
I am using git version control to save my code on github as a private resporitory. Whenever I add additional feature, I commit and push it to my main branch.

## Module List:
    cmu_graphics
    copy
    math
